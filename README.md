Taskbar App that downloads latest copied YouTube URL pasted
<h1> ⭐️ YouTube Downloader MacOs Menu Bar ⭐️ </h1>
<body>This is a simple MacOS menu bar that always stores your most recent copied link from YouTube. Whenever the icon is pressed while having a YouTube link in the clip board, you have an option to download that link into a MP4-format to your drive.</body>

<body2> Currently this app does not support saving files to a specific destination. Working on that as we speak. </body2>
